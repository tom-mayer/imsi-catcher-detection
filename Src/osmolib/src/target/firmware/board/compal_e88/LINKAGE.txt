The Compal E88 supports the common Compal RAM linkages.
These operate entirely from the Calypso internal RAM.

Flash linkages are structured as follows:

  e88loader:
    Linked at address of original compal application (0x2000).
    Provides interrupt vectors as expected by compal loader.
    Allows interrupt redirection (XXX to where?).
    
    We introduce this for the following reasons:
    1. We want to start our app at 0x10000, because that
       is the first flash page after the loader page, allowing
       us a higher degree of "unbrickability" by never reflashing
       the bootloader.
    2. We want to keep the compal loader so we do not need even
       more boot options and to allow recovery of original firmware.
    3. When there is a custom app in flash at 0xFFFF, just turning
       the phone on with the compal loader would jump into an incomplete
       motorola app. That might not even allow turning the phone off.
       The loader provides this functionality.
    4. We do not want to patch the compal loader for interrupt
       redirect and entry vectors. So we need to place something between
       0x2000 and 0x10000 anyway. And since there is space, why not put
       the whole loader in there.
    5. This loader has a good chance of being able to read crash buffers.
       and examining RAM without it being clobbered by a ram upload.

  e88flash:
    Our main application linkage, starting at 0x10000 and going through
    all of flash. Data storage locations are still to be determined.
