This is some exploratory and experimental code related
to the development of a proper lcd-based ui.

It has been written by Ingo Albrecht <prom@berlin.ccc.de>
and, lacking further arrangements, should be considered to
be licensed under the GNU GPL v2 or later.

I have placed this here due to general interest. All of it
can safely be removed once we have a proper ui.
