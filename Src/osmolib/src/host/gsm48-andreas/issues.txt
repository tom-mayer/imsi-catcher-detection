Location updating procedure:

OpenBSC:
If tx_setup fails during process, the msg must be freed to avoid memory leak.

OpenBSC:
Must use *_LOC_PRN_S_LU on protocol side.
Or it uses *_LOC_PUN_S_LU to hide private network type (maybe some cfg option)

OpenBSC:
Wrong channel is assigned when mobile supports TCH only.

LCR:
Also LCR must use correct location.
For MS support, it must use *_LOC_USER

mncc.h of openbsc / layer23:
What about putting all (except call structure) to osmocore?
