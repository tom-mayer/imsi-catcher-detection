/**
 * Timer management:
 *      - Create a struct osmo_timer_list
 *      - Fill out timeout and use add_timer or
 *        use schedule_timer to schedule a timer in
 *        x seconds and microseconds from now...
 *      - Use del_timer to remove the timer
 *
 *  Internally:
 *      - We hook into select.c to give a timeval of the
 *        nearest timer. On already passed timers we give
 *        it a 0 to immediately fire after the select
 *      - update_timers will call the callbacks and remove
 *        the timers.
