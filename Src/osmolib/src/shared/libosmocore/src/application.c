/*! \mainpage libosmocore Documentation
 * \section sec_intro Introduction
 * This library is a collection of common code used in various
 * sub-projects inside the Osmocom family of projects.  It includes a
 * logging framework, select() loop abstraction, timers with callbacks,
 * bit vectors, bit packing/unpacking, convolutional decoding, GSMTAP, a
 * generic plugin interface, statistics counters, memory allocator,
 * socket abstraction, message buffers, etc.
 * \n\n
 * Please note that C language projects inside Osmocom are typically
 * single-threaded event-loop state machine designs.  As such,
 * routines in libosmocore are not thread-safe.  If you must use them in
 * a multi-threaded context, you have to add your own locking.
