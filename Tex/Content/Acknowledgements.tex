This thesis would not have been possible without the guidance and the help of several individuals who in one way or another contributed and extended their valuable assistance in the preparation and completion of this project.

First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor Dennis Wehrle for sacrificing a considerable amount of time reading and annotating my drafts. His constructive comments were of the utmost help in improving the quality of this document.
He also gave me valuable hints and new ideas while discussing the methods used in this project.
I also want to thank Konrad Meier for helping me out whenever I was stuck, especially with the programming part in the OsmocomBB framework.

My gratitude also goes to the Chair of Communication Systems and Prof. Schneider for providing this interesting topic and all the expensive shiny toys and infrastructure I needed to complete this research.

I also wish to thank my mother, her husband and the rest of my family for constantly supporting me throughout the course of my studies.

Last but not least, I want to express my gratitude to my invaluable friends that I got to know during the last seven years.
Thank you for always being there when I needed you and for the great projects that we finished together.
