\chapter{Conclusion}

This chapter will give a short summary of the whole project and its findings.
The second section will then bring up some aspects where the \gls{icds} could be improved to yield results either faster or more accurate.

\section{Summary}

The aim of this project was to find ways of unveiling whether an IMSI catcher is being operated in the close perimeter or not; in other words to find out whether it is safe to initiate a phone call or not.
The main premise that distinguishes this project from other similar projects like the Osmocom 'catcher catcher' is that the system developed is operating in a completely passive manner.
Therefore it can only operate on a limited amount of information, namely on information that is broadcasted on publicly available channels.
The benefit this yields over other projects is that the IMSI Catcher Detection System itself is completely invisible to the IMSI catcher.
