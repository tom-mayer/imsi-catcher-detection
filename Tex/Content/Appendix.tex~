\chapter{OsmocomBB}
This section contains general information about how to operate and setup the OsmocomBB framework and the Motorola C123.
\section{Installation}
\label{sec:osmo_install}
The environment used for this project was a Thinkpad X220 Tablet running Xubuntu Linux 11.10.
The instructions should work for any other distribution of the Ubuntu product palette.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Build libraries must be installed on the operating system to enable compiling libraries.
\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install libtool shtool autoconf git-core
pkg-config make gcc wget
\end{verbatim}
	\item The GNU Arm cross compiler toolchain needs to be installed so the firmware for the Motorola C123 can be built.
	It will be added as a repository to \texttt{sources} so it can be easily removed if it is not required any more.
	\begin{verbatim}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bdrung/bsprak
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install arm-elf-toolchain
	\end{verbatim}
	\item The source code needs to be obtained.
	This can be either done by checking out the latest version of the framework from the developers, or by using the code on the CD.
\begin{verbatim}
git clone git://git.osmocom.org/osmocom-bb.git
\end{verbatim}
	\item At this point some firmwares had build errors, therefore we will compile only the firmware for the Calypso board used by the Motorola C123.
	This constraint might not be necessary if a newer version of the framework is used.
	In the \texttt{src} directory of the OsmocomBB framework the build process can be started.
	\begin{verbatim}
make BOARDS=compal_e88
	\end{verbatim}
	\item If a new version of OsmocomBB is used, the extra code from this project must be included in the build.
	The three files \texttt{catcher.c}, \texttt{app\_catcher.c} and \texttt{pch\_scan.c} must be moved to \path{osmocom-bb/src/host/layer23/src/misc} and the \texttt{Makefile.am} must be edited to include the new code.
	\begin{verbatim}
bin_PROGRAMS = bcch_scan ... cbch_sniff catcher \
				pch_scan
catcher_LDADD = $(LDADD) -lm
catcher_SOURCES = ../common/main.c app_catcher.c \ 
	catcher.c ../../../gsmmap/geo.c
pch_scan_SOURCES = ../common/main.c pch_scan.c rslms.c
	\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Usage}
\label{sec:osmo_usage}
To use a program written in the framework, the Motorola C123 needs to be flashed with the custom firmware.
This can be done with the \texttt{osmocon} application. 
\begin{verbatim}
cd src/host/osmocon

sudo ./osmocon -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -m c123xor
../../target/firmware/board/compal_e88/layer1.compalram.bin
\end{verbatim}
After \texttt{osmocon} is started and running any application can be started with root privileges.
\begin{verbatim}
cd ../layer23/src/misc/
sudo ./catcher
\end{verbatim}
The \texttt{pch\_scan} program requires an ARFCN as an input.
For example, to conduct a scan on the PCH of ARFCN 127 one would call:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo ./pch_scan -a 127
\end{verbatim}
\newpage

\section{Serial Cable Schematics}
\label{sec:osmo_serial_schematics}
A T191 unlock cable used to connect the Motorola C123 can either be obtained by ordering it from one of the mentioned stores or by building it from scratch.
These are the schematics required for building the unlock cable taken from a GSM Blog \footnote{GSM Box Schematics, \url{http://gsmringtonefree.blogspot.de/} [Online; Accessed 05.2012]}, which features images of many more cables for different brands.

\chapter{IMSI Catcher Detection System}
This section will cover some code related topics of the ICDS.

\section{Extextions}
\label{sec:extensions}
Rules, evaluators and filters are implemented in a way that new modules can be added quickly by way of inheritance and instantiating them in the constructor of the controller so they are known to the system.
The following example shows how to implement a new rule and add it to the system.
This exemplary process is nearly the same for filters and evaluators.

At first this base class has to be derived.\\\\
\hspace*{\dimexpr\fboxsep+\fboxrule}% 
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-4\fboxsep-2\fboxrule} 
\begin{lstlisting}
class Rule:
    #set whether the rule should be used by the 
    #controller
    is_active = False
    #string that will identify the rule in the report
    identifier = 'Rule'

    #the logic of the rule, will be called by controller
    def check(self, arfcn, base_station_list):
        return RuleResult.CRITICAL
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\\\\

The new rule class needs to override the check method to do something meaningful.
The identifier should also be set to a proper value.\\\\
\hspace*{\dimexpr\fboxsep+\fboxrule}% 
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-4\fboxsep-2\fboxrule} 
\begin{lstlisting}
class MyRule (Rule):
    identifier = 'My own Rule'
    def check(self,arfcn, base_station_list):
        result = RuleResult.CRITICAL
        #do some logic here and set result 
        return result
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\\\\
\texttt{arfcn} and \texttt{base\_station\_list} are given to the check method by the controller.
The first parameter is the ARFCN of the base station to which the evaluation will be applied.
The second one is a list of all the base stations with complete information as far as it has been
obtained by the ICDS.
After it has been implemented it can be instantiated and added to the list of active rules in the 
constructor of the controller.\\\\
\hspace*{\dimexpr\fboxsep+\fboxrule}% 
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-4\fboxsep-2\fboxrule} 
\begin{lstlisting}
class PyCatcherController:
    ...
    def __init__ (self):
        ...
        self.my_rule = MyRule()
        self.my_rule.is_active = True
        self._rules.add(self._my_rule)
        ...
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\section{Rx and LAC Change Test}
\label{sec:lac_change_test}
The following table contains the two configurations that have been used to test the LAC Change and rx Change Rules.
Config 6 is identical to the configuration used on the base station and thus only triggers the rx Change Rule.
Config 5 has a different LAC than the original base station and thus was used to test the former one.
Additionally the rx Change Rule is also triggered for this configuration.

\section{Database Rules Test}

The following table contains the two configurations used to test the Database Rules.
Config 6 is the same as before.
It is used to check whether the Local Area Database Rule can find the difference in reception for the replaced base station.
Config 7 features a new CID and is thus used to check if the Cell ID Database Rule is operating correctly.
